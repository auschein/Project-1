# Project-1

##Hypothesis

Our project will focus on determining which area in Austin will be more profitable by the year 2024. We will use the two zip codes of 78702 and 78745 to evaluate the data for east and south Austin, respectively. Concurrently, we will also examine several factors which can influence a homeâ€™s value, such as; the crime rate in the area over a given year, the yearly rating of schools in the zip code, the average price per square foot of the homes, and other related factors, as the data permits.
